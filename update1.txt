1 The score mode of the game basically can work right now.
  1) After run the game, go to the ScoreMode by mouse click. 
  2) The golds, rocks, miner, claw are properly displayed. 
  3) With the arrow key “down”, the claw can be stick out and get the gold and rock. 
  4) The score can be updated based on the clawed item. The behavior of gold is mostly good. But the rock cannot be erased even after been collected back.
  5) After running out of time, the mode will freeze.

2 document update:
  1) use ScoreMode as an object
  2) the claw has its own object
  3) the object of gold and rock are almost done, the object of diamond and rats still need more work.
